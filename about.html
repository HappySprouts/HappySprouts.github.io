    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p><strong>Happy Sprouts</strong> is a pediatric physical therapy clinic that welcomes children of all abilities into a warm and supportive space. We chose the name because we believe that, like sprouts, every child grows in their own time with the right care. Some of the kids we work with are building new skills, others are healing from injury, and some have conditions that make movement more challenging. No matter the situation, we focus on helping each child move with more comfort and confidence. Every session is shaped with care, patience, and respect for their unique path.</p>

    <p>Our approach to therapy is rooted in play. Children learn best when they are having fun, so we design each session around what excites and motivates them. We use games, toys, movement, and music to support strength, balance, and coordination in ways that feel enjoyable. The environment is calm and flexible, allowing children to feel safe and curious. Each activity is guided by both physical goals and emotional well-being. We want every child to leave each visit feeling proud, supported, and more confident in their body.</p>

    <p>Families are always involved in the process. We listen closely to parents and caregivers, share updates often, and offer ideas to support progress at home. Our goal is to create a team around each child, with the family at the center. We believe that small wins matter just as much as big breakthroughs‚Äîand that all progress deserves to be celebrated. At Happy Sprouts, growth is more than physical‚Äîit includes building self-esteem, resilience, and joy.</p>
